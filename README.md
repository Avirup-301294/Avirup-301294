<h1> Hi there ðŸ‘‹ </h1>
<p>I'm Avirup. I'm Computer Science graduate from Universitry of Engineering and Management. I've a keen interest to work in software and I want to make human-centric software which will help us in some way. Apart from this, I love to do Mathematics and have an long term interest in calculus. 

I'm currently learning Machine Learning and its Mathematical aspects which I assume is much needed for everyone before diving into Machine Learning or Statistical Learning.

I have worked on several projects in Web Development and I have gained a lot of experience. More specifically, technology used on those projects include Nodejs, Express and Ejs. Authentication and Authorization was also implemented with respect to those projects.
